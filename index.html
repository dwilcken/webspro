					<h2>About Me</h2>

						<h4>Navigation</h4>
						<img  src="images/main/nav.png"  alt="navigation component example" > 
						<h5>What I hope to learn</h5>
						<p> I want to learn how to effectively arrange these list times with the minimal
						amount of code. I need to work on my shorthand and when it comes arranging items 
						in a list I tend to add more code than needed. </p>
						<h5>How this relates</h5>
						<p>Every website has a navigation section. I know for myself it is what I tend to 
						use the most when browsing a site. So I can understand the importance of having a 
						functional user-friendly navigation. 
						
						<h5>How would I build this?</h5>
						<p>I've build this component like I have built all of my other navigation sections in the past,
						by using an unordered list. Followed by an input field and a search botton/icon. My HTML would
						look something like the following.(Still needs some work).</p>

						<h4>Featured Content</h4>
						<img  src="images/main/feature.png"  alt="feature component example">	
						<h5>What I hope to learn</h5>
						<p> The main objective I want to learn from this feature is how to get pictures close
						together in a square with links attached. Again it comes down to learning how to arrange
						these items effectively </p>
						<h5>How this relates</h5>
						<p>Many sites have featured content. This could include specials, articles,
						tip of the day and so on. Like the navigation bar, this tiled feature content allows the users
						to quickly access something the site owner has featured. By providing a clean and organized space
						for the featured content can allow users to achieve this. 
						<h5>How would I build this?</h5>
						<p>My initial train of thought was to create a division for the text in each box, then go into 
						css and add the background to the box and arrange by floating the items. However, since then 
						I have had some great feed back from my peers and instructor to manage this a different way.
						Below is a copy of the HTML.</p>

						<h4>Sign up</h4>
						<img  src="images/main/signup.png"  alt="sign up form component example" >
						<h5>What I hope to learn</h5>
						<p> This is the example of a sign up I'd like to create. I think that out
						of all the components I could make this one the easiest. I would however
						like to know how to store the users email address into a database so when 
						I send out an email it will automatically add everyone in the database.</p>

						<h4>Call to Action</h4>
						<img  src="images/main/cta.png"  alt="call to action component example" >
						<h5>What I hope to learn</h5>
						<p> This is another component I feel comfortable making. As a challenge I would like
						to learn how to add an animation that cycles through pictures to better help
						draw attention.</p>

						<h4>Footer</h4>
						<img  src="images/main/footer.png"  alt="footer component example" >
						<h5>What I hope to learn</h5>
						<p> It was a toss up between the footer and the feature as my featured
						component. Mainly because I want the challenge of perfecting the styling
						required to get all of the elements aligned in their respective containers.</p>
